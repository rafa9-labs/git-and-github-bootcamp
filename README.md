# Git & GitHub Bootcamp

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and practice work while learning Git and GitHub.

## What’s inside
- Practice repos / sandbox work
- Branching & merging exercises
- Conflict-resolution drills
- Tags, releases, and remotes
- Small “ship” assignments

## Goals
- Become fluent with daily Git workflows (branch → commit → merge → push)
- Learn how to recover from mistakes (rebase, reset, reflog, etc.)
- Build clean repo habits: readable commits, PR-style changes, and documentation

## How I work
- Small commits with clear messages
- Branch per feature / exercise
- Notes are written to be understandable later

## License
MIT (or none if you prefer)
